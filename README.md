# Unit 1 Asphalt Art

## Introduction

* With 2 different Painters, but similar properties, I was able to create a heart. To not only display love, but inspire residents and brighten communites around the heart. One of the Painters had the task of creating the background for the mural, while the other Painter had the task of making the heat itself.

## Reflection
1. Describe Your Project
   * My project was created in a 16x16 grid. The mural itself consists of a Navy and White stripped Back ground, with a Baby Pink heart in the middle of it. It is made up of one Superclass, and two subclasses. Each method ran, had multiple lines of code, in order to only call it once. It is very effective, but very daunting at first.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?
   * Although my projct consists of multply milestones, the top two key elements in my code would have to be the way I painted the background, as well as making the method to paint the right side of the heart. Both of these methods stole the show, because they are what took the longest time to code. When coding, I usually look for outside help, but with these methods I was determined to do them on my own.

4. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.
   * Personally, if given the opporutnity, I would combine both of the methods I wrote to paint the background into a single method. I would create a method with a parameter that could hold both the first and second color. This would reduce the code to one method, since it would interchange the colors at every line.
